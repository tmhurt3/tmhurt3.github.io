		    <h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>To know a little about me on a more personal level I am a young man from New York that aspires to help pave the way of the future. I grew up in North Carolina and I am very appreciative of my parents i feel they did an amazing job with raising me. There are many things I feel could have been better because nobody is perfect. I love my siblings a lot. They are all very smart and they teach me things everyday even though I am the oldest. They are the reason I came up with the company. I realized that us being raised differently gave us all different personalities which led me to conclude that the way children are raised greatly influences how they turn out as they get older. The main purpose of the company is to contribute to how children are raised and the mental health of the parents which will affect their children.			</p>
